# Worm 
Piece of malicious software, much like a virus, but it can replicate itself without any user interaction.
- This ovvurs because a worm will take advantage of vulnerabilities in the operating systems and applications if the organization don't mitigate these vulnerabilities by selecting the appropriate security controls and performing appropriate security patching.
- Can cause disruptions to the normal network traffic since they are constantly trying to replicate and spread across the network
- Worms are best known for spreading far and wide over the internet in a relatively short amount of time
  -  Nimda and Conficker being one of the largest worms, because it was able to infect between 9 and 15 million machines. All these machines were missing a critical security patch for the Windows operating system, specifically the Microsoft patch known as 08-067
