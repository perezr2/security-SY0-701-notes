# Rootkit
Type of software that is designed to gain administrative-level control over a given computer system without being detected. 
If somebody can install a rootkit on your system, tehy can gain root or administrative-level permission over that system. This is the highest level of permissions that somebody can have on a fiven computer system or server. 

Let's take a moment to learn how a rootkit actually works. Now, if you look at a computer system, it has several different rings of permission used throughout the system. The outermost ring is called *Ring Three*, and this is where the user permissions are going to be used. So if you're logged as a standard or regular user, you're mostly going to be operating in ring three. Now, each program can be run in different security rings, moving from ring three at the outermost level, all the way down to _Ring Zero_ at the innermost or highest permission level in the system. When you're operating in ring zero, we call this the kernel mode.

- To detect them, the best way is to boot from an external device and then scan the internal hard disk drive or solid state device to ensure you can detect those rootkits, using a good anti-malware scanning solution from a live boot Linux distribution.

## Kernel Mode
Allows a system to control access to things like device drivers, sound cards, and monitors. 

When a root kit is installed, it tries to gain the highest levels of permission possible. So any malicious code it's going to execute, we'll operate in ring one, or if they're lucky, even as low as ring zero.

- _Remember, the closer the malicious code is to ring zero or the kernel, the more permissions it's going to have and the more damage it can do on your system._

- _A rootkit is designed to really dig into your operating system deeply. So your antivirus and anti-malware solutions, have a really really hard time detecting them._

## DLL Injection
A DLL injection is a technique used to run arbitrary code within the address space of another process by forcing it to load a dynamic-link library.

- A dynamic-link library, also known as a DLL, is simply a collection of code and data that can be used by multiple programs simultaneously to allow for code reuse and modularization in software development. These DLLs are often provided by default inside of the Windows operating system.
- With a DLL injection, the malicious code is going to be inserted into a running process on a Windows machine by taking advantage of those dynamic-link libraries that are being loaded up at runtime. This means that the Windows system, doesn't even understand the fact that it has a rootkit installed inside of one of those DLLs that is then designed to load every time you boot up a Windows machine.

## Shim
A shim is simply a piece of software code that's placed between two components, and it intercepts the calls between those two components and then it can redirect those calls.
