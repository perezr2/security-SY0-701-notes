# Computer Virus
Malicious code that run on a machine without the user's knowledge and this allows the code to infect the computer whenever it has been run. There are ten different type of viruses: 

1. Boot Sector - Stored in the first sector of a hard drive and is then loaded into memory whenever the computer boots up.
   - To find and remove these viruses, use an antivirus that specifically looks for boot sector viruses.

2. Macro - A form of code that allows a virus to be embedded inside another document so that when that document is opened by the user, the  virus is executed.

3. Program - Tries to find executables or application files to infect with their malicious code

4. Multipartite - A combination of a boot sector type virus and a program virus.
   - Even if a cybersecurity professional finds the program part of the virus and cleans it out from within the operating system, they may have missed the boot sector portion.

5. Encrypted - Designed to hide itself from being detected by encrypting its malicious code or payloads to avoid detection by any antivirus software

6. Polymorphic - Advanced version of an encrypted virus, but instead of just encrypting the contents, it will actually change the virus code each time it is executed by altering the decryption module in order for it to evade detection

7. Metamorphic - Able to rewirte itself entirely before it attempts to infect a given file

8. Stealth - Not necessarily a specific type of virus as much as it is a technique used to prevent the virus from being detected by the anti-virus software

9. Armor -  Have a layer of protection to confuse a program or a person who's trying to analyze it

10. Hoax - A form of technical social engineering that attempts to scare end users into taking undesireable action on their system
