#  Spyware and Bloatware
Spyware is the type of malicious software that's designed to gather and send information about a user or organization without their knowledge.

This information can range from the user's browsing habits and software utilization patterns to more sensitive data, like passwords, credit card numbers and other relevant personal details too.

Spyware can get installed on a system in several different ways including being bundled with other software, being installed through a malicious website or be installed when a user clicks on a deceptive pop-up advertisement.

Once installed, the spyware will typically operate in the background without the user's knowledge or consent.

Spyware can cause issues because it invades your privacy, but it can also have other negative effects, such as significantly slowing down your system's performance. It is continually using your system's resources to monitor and transmit data back to the attacker who's gathering information about you.
