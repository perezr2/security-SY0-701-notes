 # Backdoor
A backdoor is originally placed into computer programs to bypass the normal security and authentication functions of those systems.

- Remote Access Trojan - A Remote Access Trojan can be placed by a threat actor onto your computer to help them maintain persistent access to your system.
  - If an attacker is able to trick one of your users into clicking on a sphere phishing link in an email, they may be able to install some kind of malware based on clicking that link, and now they have something that can create a callback connection to their system. This callback to the remote system will then allow the attacker to connect to your system while bypassing the system's default security posture. And this allows a remote access Trojan to basically act like a backdoor in order to allow the attacker to gain access to your system anytime they want.

- Easter Egg - Easter Eggs are another insecure coding practice that was used by programmers to provide a joke or gag gift to their users.

- Logic bombs - Logic bombs are a type of malicious code that's inserted into a program and that malicious code will only execute when certain conditions have been met.
