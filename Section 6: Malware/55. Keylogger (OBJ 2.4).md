# Keylogger
A piece of software or hardware that records every single keystroke that is made on a computer or mobile device. This means that every letter that is typed in, every password that is entered, and every web search that's being conducted will be captured and sent back to that threat actor without your knowledge or consent. Keyloggers are considered to be a simple, yet effective mechanism that cyber criminals can use to get direct access to your personal and financial data. keyloggers can either be software-based or hardware-based:

- When you're dealing with a software-based keylogger, these are malicious programs that get installed on a victim's computer, and they're often bundled with other software or delivered through social engineering attacks, like phishing and pretexting attacks.
  - These keyloggers can also evade antivirus detection, especially if the attacker uses sophisticated evasion techniques.
  - Once activated, the keylogger can operate silently in the background and capture every keystroke, and then transmit it back to the remote server that's controlled by a threat actor.
 
- A hardware keylogger, on the other hand, is a physical device that needs to be plugged into a computer. Usually these will resemble a USB thumb drive, or they can be embedded within the keyboard cable itself. These are considered physical devices, and that means they're harder to deploy on a large scale. But they can be very effective for use in a more targeted attack, especially since these hardware devices are immune  to software-based detection methods, like anti-malware scans.

To protect your organization from keyloggers:

- You should ensure you perform regular updates and patches on your systems.
- You should rely on quality antivirus and anti-malware solutions.
- You should conduct phishing awareness training for all your end-users.
- You should implement multifactor authentication systems.
- You should encrypt keystrokes being sent to your systems, and you should perform physical checks of your desktops, laptops, or servers to see if a hardware-based keylogger is being used.
