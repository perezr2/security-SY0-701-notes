## Visual Obstruction
Blocking the camera's line of sight (paint on camera, ect)

## Blind Sensors and Cameras
Overwhelming the sensor or camera with a sudden burst of light to render it ineffective for a limited period of time

## Acoustic Interference
Jamming or playing loud music to disrupt the microphone's functionality

## Electromagnetic Interference (EMI)
Jamming the signals that surveillance systems rely on to monitor the enviroment

## Physical Environment Attack
Exploiting the environment around the surveillance equipment to compromise its functionality. Phycial tampering, like cutting wires or physically disabling devices, is an effective strategy to bypass surveillance systems. 

Modern systems are quipped with countermeasures to help protect surveillance systems
- Tamper alarms
- Backup power supplies/UPS
- Encrypt frequencies
