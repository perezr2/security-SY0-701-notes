## Fencing
Fences can delay intruders and prevent trespassing, theft, vandalism, and unauthorized facility access.
- Provide a visual deterrent by defining a boundary that should not be violated by unauthorized personnel
- Establishes a physical barrier against unauthorized entry
- Delays intruders, which helps provide security personnel with a longer window of time to react.

## Bollards
Robust, short vertical posts, made of steel or concrete, that are designed to manage or redirect vehicular traffic. Bollards are used to keep vehicles away from buildings so that if an IED explodes nearby, the building and people are safe.
- Creates a physical barrier that shields pedestrians, structures, and other assets from potentioal vehicular collisions.
- Serves a secondary purpose as a clear visual reminder of where vehicles are not permitted
- Bollards are not invulnerable and some attackers try to degeat a bollard by tampering with or removing it.
