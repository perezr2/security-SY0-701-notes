Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) and Near Field Communication (NFC) are popular technologies uses for contractless authentication in various applications.

One of the most prevalent vulnerabilities you need to be aware of in terms of the RFID and NFC technologies is the ability to easily conduct access badge cloning to bypass your authentication systems. 

## Access Badge Cloning
Refers to copying the data from an RFID or NFC card or badge onto another card or device
- An attacker can use a handheld RFID or NFC reader to capture data from a victim's card and store it for further processing
- Once the data is captured, attackers extract the relevant authentication credentials from the card
- Using specialized writing tools, the attacker will then transfer the extracted data into a blank RFID or NFC card
- Now that the attacker has their cloned access badge or device in hand, they can gain unauthorized access to buildings, computer systems, or even make payments

Access badge cloning is considered to be a stealthy way to conduct a physical security attack. How to prevent it:
1. Implement advanced encryption in card-based authentication systems
2. Implement Multi-factor Authentication
3. Regularly update the security protocols
4. Educate the users
5. Users should implement the use of shielded wallets or sleeves with RFID access badges
6. Monitor and audit the access logs
