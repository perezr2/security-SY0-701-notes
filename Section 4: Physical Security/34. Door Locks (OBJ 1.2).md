# Door Locks
Physicall security control that is designed to secure entryways by restricting and regulating access to a particular space or property.

## Electronic locks
These locks can be configured so that each person uses their own unique identification number.

## Wireless locks

## Biometrics locks
Facial recognition scans or fingreprint identification scans.
There are some challenges with using biometrics, like the acceptance and rejection rates. 
- False Acceptance Rate (FAR) - the rate that the system authenticates a user as valid, even though that person should not have been granted access to the system.
  - To prevent unauthorized people from entering the building, ideally get that false acceptance rate down to zero by increasing the sensitivity of the scanners
- False Rejection Rate (FRR) - Occurs any time the biometrics system denies a user who should have been allowed access to the system
  - Equal Error Rate (EER) - More commonly called Crossover Error Rate (CER), which uses a measure of the effectiveness of a given biometrics system to achieve a balance
  - The lower the CER, the better that lock is going to be. 

## Cipher Lock
Provides excellent protection using a mechanical locking mechanism with push buttons that are numbered and required a person to enter the correct combination in order to open that door.

The actual moment of vulnerability arises when unauthorized individuals gain access to the building's interiors.
